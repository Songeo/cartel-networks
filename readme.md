### Sinaloa:

* __I have no data on "El Azul,"__ allegedly he prohibits narcocorridos about him and likes to keep a low profile. He's probably the third in command.
* I'm missing some of Mayo Zambada's operatives in Tijuana.
* Who's working for Sinaloa in southern Mexico?

### Tijuana



### Zetas and Gulf

* Lots of Zetas from the Monterrey area are missing


###La Familia and Ju√°rez Cartels:

* Only the basic structure
