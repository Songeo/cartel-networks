-------------------------------
This graphs were created with Gephi and only include high level cartel operatives.

Todo
====

### Sinaloa:

* There's no data on "El Azul" and allegedly he prohibits narcocorridos about him. And he's probably the third in command.
* I'm missing some of Mayo Zambada's operatives in Tijuana.
* Who do they have in southern Mexico?
* Does "El Fantasma" work for Mayo or Chapo?
* Is el JJ important enough to include, seems he is just famous for shooting Cabañas

### Tijuana

* Is "Sillas" really operating on his own?
* Who worked with Francisco Javier AF

### Zetas and Gulf

* Lot's of Zetas from the Monterrey area are missing


###La Familia and Juárez Cartels:

* Only the basic structure
