### Sinaloa:

* __I have no data on "El Azul,"__ allegedly he prohibits narcocorridos about him and likes to keep a low profile. He's probably the third in command.
* I'm missing some of Mayo Zambada's operatives in Tijuana.
* Who's working for Sinaloa in southern Mexico?
* Is el JJ important enough to include, seems he is just famous for shooting Cabañas. He did meet with "La Barbie"  a couple of months before he was caugth.
* What about Raúl Sabori?
* I don't know much about the structure of C.I.D.A.

### Tijuana

* Is "Sillas" really operating on his own?
* Who worked with Francisco Javier AF?

### Zetas and Gulf

* Lots of Zetas from the Monterrey area are missing


###La Familia and Juárez Cartels:

* Only the basic structure
